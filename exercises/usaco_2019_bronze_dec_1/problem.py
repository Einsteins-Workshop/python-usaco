# In order to improve their physical fitness, the cows have taken up gymnastics! Farmer John
# designates his favorite cow Bessie to coach the N other cows and to assess their progress
# as they learn various gymnastic skills.

# In each of K practice sessions (1 ≤ K ≤10) Bessie ranks the N cows according to their
# performance (1 ≤ N ≤ 20). Afterward, she is curious about the consistency in these rankings.
# A pair of two distinct cows is consistent if one cow did better than the other one in every
# practice session.

# Help Bessie compute the total number of consistent pairs.

# INPUT FORMAT (file gymnastics.in):

# The first line of the input file contains two positive integers K and N. The next K
# lines will each contain the integers 1…N in some order, indicating the rankings of
# the cows (cows are identified by the numbers 1…N). If A appears before B in one of
# these lines, that means cow A did better than cow B.
#

# OUTPUT FORMAT (file gymnastics.out):

# Output, on a single line, the number of consistent pairs.

# SAMPLE INPUT:
# 3 4
# 4 1 2 3
# 4 1 3 2
# 4 2 1 3

# SAMPLE OUTPUT:
# 4
# The consistent pairs of cows are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), and (1,3).

# Fill out the following function, which should return the correct answer for a file with
# the correct input file format.

# with open("gymnastics.out", "w") as f:
