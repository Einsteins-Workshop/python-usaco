# There are many math functions available in python.
addition = 10 + 5
subtraction = 10 - 5
division = 10 / 3      # This is equal to 3.333...
floor_division = 10//3 # This is equal to 3
module = 10 % 3        # This is equal to 1
power = pow(2, 10)     # This is equal to 2^10 = 1024

absolute = abs(-1)     # This is equal to 1

# There are more functions available in the math library. Here is the sqrt (square root) function:
import math
square_root = math.sqrt(16)   # This is equal to 4
