# 1. Using the print() function, print out 'Hello World!'

# 2. Print a number and then print an empty line.

# 3. Print out variables, both numbers and strings.  Add an extra empty line.
number_1 = 2
number_2 = 4
number_3 = 1.946
name = "Allanna"
greeting = "Hello, "

# 4. Print two the greeting and the name together on the same line. It should print 'Hello, Allanna'
# Also, try it with an exclamation pint added to the end of the line.

# 5. Print a number and a string together. It could print, for example, 'Hello, 5'. You can also try
# printing both variables without using concatenation, as additional arguments to print()
#

# 6. Create a list of numbers from 0 to 5

# 7. Create a list from number_1, number_2, and number_3

# 8. Print out the whole list and each of the three numbers in the list you created, each on their
# own line.

# 9. Have the program prompt for a name.

# 10. Print out that name with a greeting, e.g. 'Hello Xander!' if the user enters Xander.

# 11. Ask the first name and last name of the user, then print a custom greeting.

# 12. Ask the user for two numbers, and the print the sum of those two numbers.

# 13. Read a line of numbers, use the split() function to separate them into an array, and then print
# them.

# 14. For the array of numbers generated in step 13, print out each element times 2.
