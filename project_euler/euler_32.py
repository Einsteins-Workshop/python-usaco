# We shall say than an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all digits 1 to n exactly once; for example,
# the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
#
# The product 7524 is unusual as the identity 38 x 186 = 7524, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1
# through 9 pandigital.
#
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as 1 through 9 pandigital.
#
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way, so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
