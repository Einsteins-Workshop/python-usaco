# The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
# F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1
#
# Hence the first 12 terms will be:
# F_1 = 1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, F_8=21, F_9=34, F_10=55, F_11=89, F_12=144
#
# The twelvthh term is the first term to contain three digits.
#
# What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci squence to contain 1000 digits?
