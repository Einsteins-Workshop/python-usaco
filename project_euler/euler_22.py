# Using names.txt (https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0022_names.txt), a 46K text file
# containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then
# working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position
# in the list to obtain a name score.
#
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
# 3+15+12+9+14=53, is in the 938th position in the list. So COLIN would obtain a score of
# 938 X 42 = 49714.
#
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
