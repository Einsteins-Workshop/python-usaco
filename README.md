# python-usaco

This repository contains the materials for the Python class taught at Einstein's Workshop during the 
2024-2025 academic year. Each student should create their own branch, and rebase results as needed 
to receive new exercises.

Each USACO problem is in its own folder, and the problem.py file in each one is set up to check your
solution against the 10 data files and solutions to get your results.  There is also a commented out
section that writes the file into the format that is desired by the online checker on the USACO website.

All students are encouraged to create their own branch, but they are not permitted to merge into main.
